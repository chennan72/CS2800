CS 2800 Homework 10 - Spring 2017


This homework is to be done in a group of 2-3 students. 

If your group does not already exist:

 * One group member will create a group in BlackBoard
 
 * Other group members then join the group
 
 Submitting:
 
 * Homework is submitted by one group member. Therefore make sure the person
   submitting actually does so. In previous terms when everyone needed
   to submit we regularly had one person forget but the other submissions
   meant the team did not get a zero. Now if you forget, your team gets 0.
   - It wouldn't be a bad idea for group members to send confirmation 
     emails to each other to reduce anxiety.

 * Submit the homework file (this file) on Blackboard.  Do not rename 
   this file.  There will be a 10 point penalty for this.

 * You must list the names of ALL group members below, using the given
   format. This way we can confirm group membership with the BB groups.
   If you fail to follow these instructions, it costs us time and
   it will cost you points, so please read carefully.


Names of ALL group members: FirstName1 LastName1, FirstName2 LastName2, ...

Note: There will be a 10 pt penalty if your names do not follow 
this format.

 Inductive Proofs:
 - For all proofs below, solutions must be in the format described in class and
   in the notes. This includes:
     * Explicitly identifying an induction scheme and the function that gives
       rise to it.
     * Labeling general context (C1, C2....) and derived context.
     * Providing justifications for each piece of derived context.
     * Explicitly identifying axioms and theorems used
     * The if axioms and theorem substitutions are not required. You can use
       any other shortcuts previously identified.
     * PL can be given as justification for any propositional logic rules with the
      exceptions of Modus Ponens (MP) and Modus Tollens (MT)
     * Hocus Pocus (HP) is not permissible justification.
     * All arithmetic rules can be justified by writing "Arithmetic".
     
Previous homeworks (such as HW05) identify these requirements in more detail.

For this homework you may want to use ACL2s to help you.

Technical instructions:

- open this file in ACL2s as hw10.lisp

- make sure you are in BEGINNER mode. This is essential! Note that you can
  only change the mode when the session is not running, so set the correct
  mode before starting the session.

- insert your solutions into this file where indicated (usually as "...")

- only add to the file. Do not remove or comment out anything pre-existing
  unless asked to.

- make sure the entire file is accepted by ACL2s. In particular, there must
  be no "..." left in the code. If you don't finish all problems, comment
  the unfinished ones out. Comments should also be used for any English
  text that you may add. This file already contains many comments, so you
  can see what the syntax is.

- when done, save your file and submit it as hw10.lisp

- avoid submitting the session file (which shows your interaction with the
  theorem prover). This is not part of your solution. Only submit the lisp
  file!

Instructions for programming problems:

For each function definition, you must provide both contracts and a body.

You must also ALWAYS supply your own tests (unless otherwise noted). This is in 
addition to the tests sometimes provided. Make sure you produce sufficiently 
many new test cases. This means: cover at least the possible scenarios 
according to the data definitions of the involved types. For example, 
a function taking two lists should have at least 4 tests: all combinations 
of each list beingempty and non-empty.

Beyond that, the number of tests should reflect the difficulty of the
function. For very simple ones, the above coverage of the data definition
cases may be sufficient. For complex functions with numerical output, you
want to test whether it produces the correct output on a reasonable
number of inputs.

Use good judgment. For unreasonably few test cases we will deduct points.

; Part I: Induction schemes
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#|

Below, you are given the proof obligations generated by
induction schemes. Your job is to define admissible functions, 
using defunc that give rise to these induction schemes. 
phi|(...) denotes phi under substitution ...
IF an admissible function is possible, write it and make sure 
that ACL2s accepts your function definition.
Otherwise, briefly explain why no admissible function can generate
that induction scheme and provide a sample call that would 
be problematic.

For these functions (f1-f7) you do not need to provide
tests (i.e., no check= forms are required). It is also
a good idea to make these functions as simple as possible.

Question 1A)
1. (not (rationalp x)) => phi
2. (and (rationalp x) (< x 0)) => phi
3. (and (rationalp x) (not (< x 0)) phi|((x (- x 1)))  => phi

    => phi
4. (and (listp x)(integerp y)(not (endp x))

    => phi
5. (and (listp x)(integerp y)(not (endp x))

Question 1D)
NOTE: The induction scheme below has been slightly simplified to avoid
the expression being too unruly (eg for obligation 3 you would see 
(not (equal x 1)))
1. (not (natp x)) => phi
2. (and (natp x) (equal x 1)) => phi
3. (and (natp x) (equal x 2)) => phi
4. (and (natp x) (equal x 0)) => phi

        (endp x)(< y -1) phi|((y (+ y 1)))) => phi 
4. (and (listp x) (integerp y) (not (and (endp x) (equal y -1)))

        (not (and (endp x)(< y -1)))
        (not (endp x)) (phi|((x (rest x))))) => phi 

Hint: phi|((a (rest a)) (b b)) is the same as 
      phi|((a (rest a))).  You can leave off variable parameters 
      that don't change.

;; PART II: Quicksort
;; You will now write various functions involved
;; in the quicksort algorithm. 
;; See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort for 
;; additional information about the algorithm.
;; You will also have to prove 
;; several conjectures along the way.
;; For each test? below, PROVE the conjecture (induction will 
;; probably be needed somewhere).  The conjecture  will be provided
;; in the comment.
;; Ex: (test? (implies (lorp l) (sortedp (qsort l))))
;; You will need to prove
;; phi: (lorp l) => (sortedp (qsort l))
;;
;; Make sure you clearly identify your induction scheme and what 
;; function it comes from for EACH proof.
;;
;; Please also note that since you are writing the functions before
;; you do the proofs, your implementation may change the proof. Some
;; implementations are easier to prove than others.  
;; *** If you get stuck with your proofs, consider revising your code
;; If everyone is getting stuck, I'm willing to provide function bodies, 
;; but I would like to wait and see if problems arise ***
;;
;; Some induction schemes are also easier to use than others.  
;; My stategy for choosing an I.S. is:
;; 1) Choose the simplest I.S. that changes variables like your functions will
;;    -> As a first pass, I always look at nind and listp in case they work.
;; 2) Make sure there are no variables in the I.S. that are not in the conjecture
;; 3) Choose an I.S. that provides useful context in your proof.
;; 4) Try to have your base cases in the I.S. match the recursive base cases.

We start with some familiar definitions just in case they
are useful. You will be asked to
define functions later on. Make sure to use defunc.

(defunc listp (x)
  :input-contract t
  :output-contract (booleanp (listp x))
  (if (consp x)
      (listp (rest x))
    (equal x nil)))

(defunc app (a b) 
  :input-contract (and (listp a) (listp b))
  :output-contract (listp (app a b))
  (if (endp a)
      b
    (cons (first a) (app (rest a) b))))

(defunc rev (a) 
  :input-contract (listp a) 
  :output-contract (listp (rev a))
  (if (endp a)
      nil
    (app (rev (rest a)) (list (first a)))))

;; NOTICE: We slightly modified the definition of in
;; to help make the induction scheme easier to follow.

;; GIVEN
;; qsort: lor -> lor
;; (qsort l) takes a list of rationals l and sorts the

;; To think about: what would be a measure function for qsort and what 
;; are the proof obligations? How big are the lists returned from 
;; filter-gte and filter-less?
;;.......These are rhetorical questions. You do not have to provide an answer.

(test? (implies (and (lorp l1)(lorp l2)
                     (sortedp l1)(sortedp l2)

  /\ (consp l2) /\ (< (first (rev l1)) (first l2)) => (sortedp (app l1 l2))

To do induction, you need to ensure l1 is not empty. Are there 
any functions that stop before (endp l1)? 

You may also need a lemma showing the last of a list STAYS 
the last of the list for (rest l)

(rationalp e)/\(rationalp r)/\(lorp l)/\(in e (filter-less r l)) => (< e r)
                             
You may assume that if (in e (filter-less r l)) is true and e = (first l)
then you MUST take the (cons (first l)(filter-less r (rest l))) branch
of filter-less.

(test? (implies (lorp l)(equal (in e (qsort l))(in e l))))

**Presume the following is a theorem.**
(defthm phi_perm_qsort (implies (lorp l)(equal (in e l)(in e (qsort l)))))
|#

(test? (implies (lorp l) (sortedp (qsort l))))

#|
6)
Prove: phi_qsort: (implies (lorp l) (sortedp (qsort l)))

Show that you are smarter than ACL2s: Prove that qsort produces a 
sorted list.ACL2s can't prove this without help (and proving the 
assumed theorem phi_perm_qsort is much more difficult than it looks) 
maybe you can.
Notice that the test? above, however, should pass.

Think about what a good induction scheme to use would be.
Remember, that EACH recursive call provides an inductive
assumption where variables are substituted to their value
at the next recursive call (so variable changes can be more
complex than just (- n 1) or (rest l)).
HINT: You may also want to do a proof-by-cases
within one of the induction scheme cases if you don't know whether
a list is empty or not.

Each week we will ask a couple questions to monitor how the course
is progressing.  This should be the same length as the HW07 survey. 

Please fill out the following form.

https://goo.gl/forms/tGE0FMdiPLoV57j13

As before, feedback is anonymous and each team member should fill out
the form (only once per person).

After you fill out the form, write your name below in this file, not
on the questionnaire. We have no way of checking if you submitted the
file, but by writing your name below you are claiming that you did,
and we'll take your word for it.  

5 points will be awarded to each team member for filling out the 
questionnaire.

The following team members filled out the feedback survey provided by 
the link above:
---------------------------------------------
<firstname> <LastName>

Get ACL2s to prove all of the theorems you were asked to prove by
hand for qsort, including any lemmas you needed to discover. Here is how you
do that.  

Suppose that the theorem you want to prove is 

(listp x) => (app x nil) = x

First, turn it into a legal ACL2s expression and second use
the "defthm" form, which requires giving the theorem a name. Here
is what the defthm will look like:

(defthm app-x-nil-thm
  (implies (listp x)
           (equal (app x nil)
                  x)))

One thing to keep in mind is that if you have a defthm of 
the form 

(1) hyp1 /\ hyp2 /\ ... /\ hypn => (f ...) = (g ...)

then you could write it as

(2) hyp1 /\ hyp2 /\ ... /\ hypn => (g ...) = (f ...)

Logically there is no difference, but in ACL2s there is a big
difference. Put the more "complicated" of (g ...) and (f ...) on
the left of the equality because ACL2s uses the defthms as what
are called rewrite rules, i.e., if you defthm is of form (1) then
ACL2s replaces (f ...) by (g ...) but not the other way around.

Finally place the defthms in the same order as you were asked to
prove them and lemmas that were used in the proof of a theorem
should come before the theorem.

Unlike in previous terms, this may not be easy. There may be some
trial and error necessary to find additional theorems that can help
you in your proofs.  Hence the bonus.  Do this problem for fun or
personal interest.  I wouldn't do this for the points.

** YOU CAN STILL GET 100% ON THIS ASSIGNMENT WITHOUT DOING THIS BONUS
QUESTION.  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO
BEYOND THE BASIC ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS.**
